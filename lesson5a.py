# python functions
# they are block of code/ statements that perform a given task/action. they can be reused through out the program to perform different tasks.
# functions are defined using the def keyword.(define)
# we have two main types of functions i.e:
# 1. in-built function =>-> They come preinstalled with the interpreter i.e print(), pop(), range(), append() etc...
# 2. User defined functions => They are created by a programmer to solve a given task.
# To define a function you need to give it a name followed by parenthesis.
# For the functions, it is usually indented and to invoke a function we use the function name.
