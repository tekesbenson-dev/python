# what is a variable: Variables are lables which act as containers to hold values. In python a variable is always asociated with some values
#We use the assignment operator (=) to assign values to a variable
# anything that is inside of quotes in python is called a string
message = "Hello There! Hope everything is fine?"
print(message)

message2 = "Good Bye!"
print(message2)

#cocatenating variables (Joining two or more outputs together)
message3 = message + message2
print(message3)

# variables can be named using a letter, number and an underscore. They can start with a letter and an underscore but not a number
_name1 = "Brendah"
print(_name1)
# Names cannot contain spaces. We can use the underscore to separate the names.
total_marks = 85
print(total_marks)
# Variable names are not supposed to be keywords/ reserved characters in python
